//asyncrnoius and syncreiuos in js

//syncrous js
// synchronous simply means that the code is executed line by line, in the exact order of execution that we defined in our code,

/*So each line of code always waits for the previous line to finish execution. Now this can create problems when one line of code takes a long time to run.*/

////
/*Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one*/

//eg  setTimeout

console.log('is my pizza ready');

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('your pizza is ready');
}, 2000);

console.log('please wait for your pizza to be ready');

//in this above example  first   'is my pizza ready'   will be printed
//then  set time out will be jumped becouse it will take time to get the result and  'please wait for your pizza to be ready' will be printed

//then finally  the call back finction is excuted 'your pizza is ready'  will be printed     this shows then program flow is not blocked in asyncrynous  but in  synchronous it blocked

///note

/*we need a callback function to implement this asynchronous behavior, right?
However, that does not mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous.

That is just not the case, okay? For example, the Array map method

accepts a callback function as well, but that doesn't make the code asynchronous.

Only certain functions such as set timeout work in an asynchronous way.We just have to know which ones do

and which ones don't, okay?*/

// callback functions-- alone do not make code asynchronous,
//EventListener--- Alone dosent make code asynchronous

//other exmample of asynchrnous is   Geolocation API, AJAX call

///AJAX

//Ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and basically it allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way.

//we make Ajax calls in our code in order to request some data from a web server dynamically.So without reloading the page

/*So let's say that we have our JavaScript application running in the browser,which is also called the Client.

And we want the application to get some data from a web server.*/

/*So with Ajax, we can do an HTTP request to the server, which has this data. And the server will then set back a response

containing that data that we requested.And this back and forth between Client and server .all happens asynchronously in the background,*/

//different types of requests,like get requests to receive data or post requests to send data to a server.

//API stands for Application Programming Interface.Now in general terms,and on the very high level of obstruction,

/*an API is basically a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software in order to basically allow applications

to talk to each other and exchange information.*/

/*Now in JavaScript and web development,there are countless types of APIs,like the DOM API

or the Geolocation API that we have been using.So these are called APIs because they are a self-contained piece of software that allow other pieces of software to interact with them.

*/

/*So an online API  is essentially an application running on a web server, which receives requests for data,

then retrieves this data from some database and then sends it back to the client.*/

//Now, of course we can build or own Online APIs, but that requires back-end development.So development with servers and databases and all that.

/*So Ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML.Remember? So the X there stands for XMLand XML is a data format,

which used to be widely used to transmit data on the web.However, these days basically no API uses XML data anymore.

The term Ajax is just an old name that got very popular back in the day, and so it's still used today,even though we don't use XML anymore.

So instead, most APIs these days use the JSON data format.So JSON is the most popular data format today because it's basically just a JavaScript object,

but converted to a string. And so therefore,it's very easy to send across the web and also to use in JavaScript once the data arrives.*/

/////////////////
/*So now that we know about AJAX and API's,let's actually make our first API call.So in this lecture, we're gonna build a nice UI component,*/

//which contains data about a certain country. And this data about the countries is actually gonna come from a third party online API.

/*Now in JavaScript, there are actually multiple ways of doing AJAX calls.But we're gonna start with the most old school one.

And that's called the XML HTTP request function.*/

// const btn = document.querySelector('.btn-country');
// const countriesContainer = document.querySelector('.countries');

//So basically, callback hell is when we have a lot of nested callbacks in order to execute asynchronous tasks in sequence. but call bach hell is deficult to understand







////////////  PROMISE
//NEW WAY TO GET API

//const request = fetch('https://restcountries.com/v2/name/eritrea'); //the promise is stored in the  request
//console.log(request); //return  promise

//what is promise
//promises are an ES6 feature. So they became available in JavaScript in 2015.

//- promise is an object that is used as a place holder for the future result of an asynchronous operation

//or   a container for an asynchronousely deliverd value

//or we can say  a container for future value

//perfect example of the future value is  response from ajax call

//Now, what's the big advantage of using promises
// 1.first by using promises we no longer need to rely on event and callback functions to handle asynchronous results, events and callback functions can sometimes cause unpredictable results.

//2but even better with promises, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations instead of nesting like we did in the last video. And with this,we can finally escape callback hell,

//since promises work with asynchronous operations,they are time sensitive. So they change over time. And so promises can be in different states

//life sycle of promise
/*So in the very beginning,we say that a promise is pending.And so this is before any value resulting from the

asynchronous task is available.Now, during this time,the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background.

Then when the task finally finishes, we say that the promise is settled and there are two different types of settled promises and that's 1.fulfilled promises and 2. rejected promises.*/

// states of promise 1.fulfilled promises and 2. rejected promises

/*a fulfilled promise is a promise that has successfully resulted in a value just as we expect it.For example, when we use the promise to fetch data

from an API,a fulfilled promise successfully gets that data,and it's now available to being used.*/

/*a rejected promise means that there has been an error during the asynchronous task.And the example of fetching data from an API,an error would be for example,when the user is offline and can't connect to the API server.*/

//important Note :promise is setteled once  after seatled ether to fullfilled or rejected  they are not get changed

/*So we consume a promise when we already have a promise, for example,the promise that was returned from the fetch function,right at the beginning of this video, remember.But in order for a promise to exist in the first place,

it must first be built.So it must be created in the case of the fetch API,it's the fetch function that builds the promise and returns it for us to consume.So in this case,we don't have to build the promise ourselves in order to consume it.

Now, most of the time we will actually just consume promises,which is also the easier and more useful part*/

///Consuming promises

///this is the modern way to get data from the web API  using promise

// const getCountryData = function (country) {
//   fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`) // the fetch returns the promise
//     .then(function (response) {
//       //then   method handles the promise
//       console.log(response);
//       //then we will need json to read the response
//       return response.json(); // in order to read data  we call 'json' on the response  also json is a asyncrouse itself means it is runing in the back ground for its response to work so we need to call a methode'then' to hundle  json also
//     })
//     .then(function (data) {
//       //console.log(data); //this will give us the diserd data of the response
//       renderCountry(data[0]);
//     });
//};
//getCountryData('portugal');

//we want to use arrow function for the above code

// const getCountryData = function (country) {
//   fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`) // the fetch returns the promise

Now, the heart of every JavaScript runtime is the engine. So, this is where code is actually executed and where objects are stored in memory.

So, these two things happen in the call stack  and in the heap.
*/

/*
Now, what's important to note here is that JavaScript has only one threat of execution.

And so it can only do one thing at a time.There is absolutely no multitasking happening  in JavaScript itself.

Now, other languages like Java can execute multiple pieces of code at the same time, but not JavaScript.
*/

//js have only one thread of execution  , it means it will do one thing at the time

/*next we have 
--the web APIs environment.These are some APIs provided to the engine, but which are actually not part of

the JavaScript language itself. So, that's things like the DOM timers  the fetch API, the geolocation API, and so on and so forth.*/

/*Next up, there is the 
--callback queue  and this is a data structure that holds all the ready to be executed callback functions that are attached to some event that has occurred.

-Finally, whenever the call stack is empty the
-event loop takes callbacks from the callback queue and puts them into call stack so that they can be executed.

So the event loop is the essential piece that makes asynchronous behavior possible in JavaScript.

It's the reason why we can have a non blocking concurrency model in JavaScript. And a concurrency model is simply how a language handles multiple things happening at the same time.
*/

/*let's focus on the essential parts of the runtime here.  So, that's the call stack the event loop the web APIs and to callback queue.

So, as you know, by now, a JavaScript engine is built  around the idea of a single thread

-question : But if there was only one thread of execution in the engine then how can asynchronous code be executed  in a non blocking way?*/

/*as you already know everything related to the DOM is not really part of JavaScript, but of the web APIs. 

And so it's in a web APIs environment where the asynchronous tasks related to the DOM will run.

And in fact, the same is true for timers AJAX calls and really all other asynchronous tasks. 

So, again, these asynchronous tasks will all run in the web API environment of the browser.

- for example if we have image is loading its doing it asyncrousley in the background which means in the web Api not in call stuck 
becouse if it was in call stack it will block the other codes to excute  becouse loding image takes time */

/*if we want to do something after the image has finished loading, then we need to listen to the load event.

And so that's exactly what we do in the next line of code. So, here we attach an event listener

to the load event of that image and pass an a callback function as always. In practice, this means to register this callback

in the web APIs environment, exactly where the image is loading. then after the image finshed loading the callback function of the image which attached is put in callback qeue 

-And the callback queue is basically an ordered list of all the callback functions that are in line to be executed.

-note that if there is another call back in the queue  then  the new callback ordered behind the first call back on the queue


Now, another thing that's important to mention here is that the callback queue also contains callbacks coming from DOM events like clicks or key presses or whatever.

Now, we learned before that DOM events are not really asynchronous behavior, but they still use the callback queue to run their attached callbacks.
*/

/*event loop--So, here is what the event loop does.It looks into the call stack and determines whether it's empty or not.

Except of course for the global context,then if the stack is indeed empty which means that there's currently no code being executed

then it will take the first callback from the callback queue nd put it on the call stack two will be executed. And this is called an "event loop tick".

event loop has the extremely important task of doing coordination between the call stack and to callbacks in the callback queue.

So, the event loop is basically who decides exactly when each callback is executed.*/

/**Another thing that becomes clear from this whole explanation is that the JavaScript language itself has actually no sense of time.

That's because everything that is asynchronous does not happen in the engine. It's the runtime who manages all the asynchronous behavior.*/

/*So, in a nutshell, the web APIs environment, the callback queue  and the event loop, all together, make it possible that asynchronous code can be executed in a non blocking way 
even with only one thread of execution in the engine.*/

//Note : call back coming from promises is not going to call back QUEUE  instead they  have special queue  called "micro tasks queue"  and  callback that came from promises have priority over the callback in the callback queue
//the event loop first  take the callback in mixcrotask queue  to be excuted then when it finsh with it goes to callback queue

//event loop practice

console.log('test start'); // 1 st to print  this will first print

setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0); // then lastly we get othis printed since  it runs after the  promise in micro tasks queue

Promise.resolve('test resolved').then(res => console.log(res));

Promise.resolve('resolve 2').then(res => {
  //since the secound promis take long to excute the timer needs to wait
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {}
  console.log(res);
});
console.log('test end'); // 2 to print
